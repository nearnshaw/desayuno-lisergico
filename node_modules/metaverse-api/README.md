# Decentraland SDK

## Getting started

First, install Typescript in your project (for more information see [Why Typescript?](#why-typescript)):

    npm i typescript --save-dev

Then, install the SDK's npm package:

    npm i metaverse-api --save-dev

Specify a `build.json` file, this is used to easily configure build steps:

    [
        {
            "name": "Compile systems",
            "kind": "Webpack",
            "file": "./scene.tsx",
            "target": "webworker"
        }
    ]

Finally, add a new command to your npm scripts:

    "scripts": {
        "build": "metaverse-compiler build.json"
    }

Run that command to transpile your Typescript files on-demand.

From here on you can use the [CLI](https://github.com/decentraland/cli) to deploy your scene.

## Why Typescript?

Typescript is a superset of Javascript and allows Object Oriented Programming as well as type declaration, Both this featues are key when aiming to provide a good developer experience. Features like autocomplete and type-checking speed up development times and allow for the creation of a solid codebase.

If you wish to use another tool or language, you are free to do so as long as the end result is a single Javascript file (`scene.js`). Keep in mind that all provided type declarations are Typescript only, so other languages and transpilers will lack official support.

## Using JSX

To use JSX syntax inside your script you need to import the following module:

```tsx
import { createElement } from 'metaverse-api'
```

And use it like:

```tsx
//  @inject("EntityController") entityController: EntityController | null = null;

async render() {
    await this.entityController!.render(<box position="0 0 0" />)
}
```
